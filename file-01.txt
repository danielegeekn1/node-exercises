It is unsafe to use fs.writeFile() multiple times on the same file without waiting for the callback. For this scenario, fs.createWriteStream() is recommended.

Similarly to fs.readFile - fs.writeFile is a convenience method that performs multiple write calls internally to write the buffer passed to it. For performance sensitive code consider using fs.createWriteStream().

It is possible to use an <AbortSignal> to cancel an fs.writeFile(). Cancelation is "best effort", and some amount of data is likely still to be written.
